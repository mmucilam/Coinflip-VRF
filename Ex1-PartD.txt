Exercise 1 – Part D

Whilst it is evident that significant progress has been made with respect to blockchain technology, there still lie technical challenges that require addressing. One of these issues is the gas usage per random number request, which can depend on the network congestion and the complexity of the request. Therefore, a level of unpredictability is introduced to transaction costs, which affects both users and businesses.

From the business perspective, running a crypto coinflip game involves several costs pertinent to consider. For starters, there is funding required for smart contracts, including both the VRF contract and the standalone game contract. Also, as mentioned, we may find ongoing costs associated with transaction fees for requesting random numbers, which accumulate dependant on the frequency of gameplay and the surrounding network conditions. From the user’s perspective, the unpredictability of gas fees and transaction fees are key factors that impact engagement and individual satisfaction. If users face long delays or experience higher costs due to periods of network congestion, they may fee less inclined to continue using a particular platform.
