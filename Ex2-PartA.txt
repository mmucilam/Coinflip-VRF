Exercise 2 – Part A

When referencing the DeFi landscape, MakerDAO stands at the forefront, as a pioneering protocol which offers Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs), which enable users to generate DAI stablecoins by locking up collateral assets such as ETH. By running a quick search on DeFiLama and Dune Analytics, we are able to gain a comprehensive view of MakerDAO’s position. Primarily, MakerDAO competes with platforms such as Sovryn Zero, Parallel Protocol, and Acala Dollar.

By analysing key metrics like Total Value Locked (TVL) and Market Cap to TVL ratio, we shed light on each protocol’s relative position. Here, MakerDAO boasts a TVL of $22 billion, which would indicate a significant position within the market and a substantial user base and adoption of its CDP offerings. Sovyrn Zero and Acala Dolla, on the other hand, exhibit smaller TVLs of approximately $29.4 million and $20.21 million respectively, figures which indicate a much smaller user base and smaller market share of CDP offerings. Taking a look at Market Cap to TVL ratios, Sovryn Zero, or Acala Dollar, Parallel Protocol's ratio of 0.24 could indicate potential undervaluation or higher liquidity relative to its TVL. 

Additionally, MakerDAO’s stability and reliability can be further highlighted by its steady availability and reliability through its steady DAI supply, which indicates a steady demand for the stablecoin. MakerDAO’s combination of market dominance in CDPs, along with its robust ecosystem and widespread community support, positions the protocol as a leader in the DeFi landscape. A continuous monitorization of key metrics will be crucial for assessing the both evolving dynamics of the CDP market and as the competitive positioning of MakerDAO and its competitors.
